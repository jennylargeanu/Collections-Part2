    <h1>Ferrari 488</h1>

<p>This photo was taken after concert on thanksgiving weekend. My boyfriend is a car enthusiast and encouraged me to take a photo of this beautiful car. I don't know much about cars but I know for sure that Ferrari cars aren't common and that they're very fast cars. In front of the Ferrari was another car that we don't see very often, called the Nissan GTR. I thought to myself, who owns these cars? Are they friends and parked next to eachother, or was it just a coincidence? Why were they parked on the street and not in a private parking lot? </p>

<p>That night, we went to go see Deadmau5. When Deadmau5 came on stage, the venue was full of people. Once the concert ended, we got a ride back home, but on the way to our ride, we came across the 2 cars. We were surprised to see them parked out on the street, especially on a night of a concert with hundreds of drunk young adults walking back to their rides. They must've had a lot of trust. My boyfriend and I never figured out who owns these but we assumed that it was either the owner of Rebel, or one of Deadmau5 friends. We know for sure it wasn't Deadmau5 because he never posted about this car.</p>
    
 
<h2>Facts</h2>

<p>If you check out the license plate, It says "Mr 204". It could either be an inside joke, or his lucky number, but I assumed that it was the area code for manitoba, therefore the owner could be from Manitoba, and registered their car in Ontario. This car is powered by a 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine, assembled in Maranello, Italy. They were made between 2015-2020. It was named supercar of the year in 2015 by Top Gear.</p>
