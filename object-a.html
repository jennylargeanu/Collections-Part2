    <h1>Canadian National 6213</h1>

<p>My boyfriend and i went on a little trip to Toronto on Thanksgiving weekend. We first went to see a concert, and then the day after, decided to go walk around downtown. On our way to the CN Tower, we came across Toronto Railway Museum. It was my first time visiting this museum, so decided to walk around and take a look at the trains.</p>
    
<p>There were many trains at this location, including old railways that was used back in the days. I imagined myself being in the late 1800's or early 1900's, picturing myself walking around old Toronto, seeing these trains arriving at this station. After spending some time looking at the trains, I saw one that caught my eye. The Canadian National 6213. It's a huge Black train, probably one of the biggest one out of all the trains I saw there, and it almost looks modern. With the view of the CN Tower behind the train, I had to take a photo. It was hard to take a photo cause it was gated but I put my phone through the gate and caught a pretty neat photo.</p>
 
<h2>History</h2>

<p>After doing some research, I found out that this train is a preserved 4-8-4 steam locomotive. It was first built in 1942 by Montreal Locomotive Works and it was being used until 1959. In 1960, Canadian National Railway donated it to the city of Toronto government. This train is still functional, as they use it to push it back and forth on the turntable located in the  Roundhouse. This allows the staff to lube and grease up the moving mechanics, to keep the locomotive preserved. They also have plans on restoring the engine, and to make it fully operable in the future.</p>
